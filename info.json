        "Pour water into a mixer bowl and crumble yeast into them. Sift flour into a separate bowl and add to the kneading bowl with salt and olive oil. Put using a kneading hook at low speed for 3 minutes to combine the ingredients. Increase the kneading speed to medium and put another 4 minutes until a relatively hard dough is obtained. If the dough is soft, add 3-2 tablespoons of flour in the kneading step.",
        "Form the dough into a ball and place in a lightly floured bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel (or cling film) and puff for 40 minutes until the dough almost doubles in volume.",
        "Place a slanted brick (or inverted oven pan) on the bottom of the oven and preheat the oven to 180 degrees.",
        "Cross the dough with a parchment or knife and roll each piece on a lightly floured work surface into a roll. Slightly flatten the cylinder into a rectangular shape. Cover with a kitchen towel and swell for 20 minutes.",
        "Roll out the rectangles of dough to a size of 30 Ã— 40 cm and transfer to greased pans. At this point the dough slightly shrinks towards the center of the mold. Cover the dough with a towel and wait about 5 minutes. Stretch the dough towards the corners of the mold. Surface in the palm pad then pat with the fingers.",
        "Prepare tomato sauce: Heat a pan with olive oil and fry garlic for a few seconds until fragrant but without browning. Add tomatoes and sugar and cook over medium heat for 7 minutes to qualify (if preparing canned tomatoes, cook for another 10 minutes to get rid of side effects). Season. Store in the refrigerator for up to two to three days.",
        "Prepare the eggplants: Brush the eggplant slices on both sides with olive oil and arrange in a pan lined with baking paper.",
        "Raise the oven temperature to 250 degrees.",
        "Bake the eggplants for 8 minutes on each side until soft (they will undergo further baking on the pizza so they do not need to be browned well at this point). Cool to room temperature.",
        "Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the dough and leave a margin of 1 cm. Arrange over eggplant slices and swell for 30 minutes.",
        "Bake 15-12 minutes until dough is golden.",
        "When the pizza comes out of the oven, pour over tehini and a little olive oil and sprinkle with salt and chopped parsley."
